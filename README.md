# Jeopardy-Game

This app uses Axios to make API calls to the jservice API (http://jservice.io/).  When the player clicks the "New Question" button, a JSON file is returned containing a question and other relevant data such as the correct answer. This data is then displayed to the player to simulate a Jeopardy game.
